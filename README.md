# Ty's Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio website â€” a central hub where recruiters, professors, and mentors can explore my background, experience, and technical work.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site showcases a selection of projects with GitHub links, provides an overview of my academic and professional background, and includes contact information.

The portfolio is designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate. It serves both as an interactive resume and a professional presence on the web.

### Features

- Interactive project carousel with direct GitHub links
- Clean, mobile-friendly layout
- Resume and contact information in one central place

### Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to create a polished, professional online portfolio that demonstrates my capabilities as an engineering student with coding experience. It also gave me hands-on experience designing a user interface and building a site from scratch using web technologies.
